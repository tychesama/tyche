# Tyche01.fun Monorepo

## Overview

**Tyche01.fun** started as a personal portfolio and has gradually evolved into a collection of projects showcasing my work and interests. The website is designed to be straightforward, simple, and functionality-focused, highlighting my skills and past experiences.

This repository is a **monorepo** containing multiple projects, including:

- **Portfolio** – The original project, intended to showcase myself and my works.
- **Blog** – A place to document thoughts, learnings, and updates.
- **Home** – Landing page for my website, which will be a hub for my future project deployments.

## Origins

- The project began as a portfolio, inspired by suggestions from internship peers and my own interest in building a personal site.  
- Design decisions started without the use of Figma or other design tools; initial sketches were created with pen, paper, and even simple tools like Paint.
- Design is now further developed using Figma for ease of use. 
- Tyche01.fun is my first deployed website with a domain.  
- Over time, the portfolio grew to include multiple projects and sections, evolving beyond its original purpose.

## Purpose

The site serves as a compilation of:

- My past works
- Projects I’ve undertaken
- A personal showcase of skills and experience

The focus is on simplicity and functionality, providing a clear representation of myself and my work.
